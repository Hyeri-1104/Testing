üìò Basic Knowledge Set: Cookie Consent (for AI Chatbot Training)

üß† Purposes of Data Processing

1. Understand audiences through statistics
   - Used to measure and analyze how users interact with content.
   - Helps generate aggregated reports on user engagement patterns.
   - Example: Knowing how many people read a certain article.

2. Create profiles for personalised advertising
   - Builds profiles based on browsing history, device use, and preferences.
   - Enables serving tailored ads that match user interests.

3. Use profiles to select personalised advertising
   - Applies a pre-existing user profile to determine which ad to show.
   - Ensures more relevant ad targeting.

4. Measure advertising performance
   - Tracks views, clicks, and conversions for ads.
   - Assesses which ads are effective or ignored.

5. Store and/or access information on a device
   - Involves saving or retrieving identifiers (like cookies) on a device.
   - Enables site to remember preferences or sessions.

üõ†Ô∏è Features and Special Features

6. Match and combine data from other data sources
   - Links user behavior on this site with data from loyalty cards, surveys, other sites.
   - Enables more complete user profiles.

7. Link different devices
   - Identifies that the same user is active across multiple devices (e.g., phone and laptop).
   - Helps maintain consistency in personalization and analytics.

8. Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically
   - Uses passive signals like IP address, screen size, fonts to distinguish devices.
   - Helps with fraud prevention and identity resolution.

9. Use precise geolocation data
   - Collects exact GPS-based location data from the device (within a few meters).
   - Requires user consent.

10. Actively scan device characteristics for identification
    - Examines hardware/software traits (e.g., OS version, browser plugins).
    - Used for fingerprinting and fraud prevention.

üì• Types of Data Collected

11. Cookies
    - Small text files saved on a device to retain user information between sessions.

12. Device identifiers
    - Unique IDs like Apple‚Äôs IDFA or Android's AdID used to track users across apps and sites.

13. Browser type and settings
    - Info like browser version, language, or screen resolution.

14. Location data
    - May include approximate or precise GPS location (if allowed).

15. Email address
    - Typically not collected through passive cookies unless user provides it actively.

‚öñÔ∏è Legal Basis for Data Processing

16. Consent
    - Explicit user permission is required before collecting or using personal data.
    - Common for personalized advertising, location, or profile creation.

17. Legitimate Interest
    - Allows data collection without prior consent if there‚Äôs a clear business interest.
    - Users have the right to opt out.
    - Example: basic analytics or fraud detection.

üß© AI Training Notes

- Associate ‚Äúpurposes‚Äù with why data is used.
- Associate ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù with how data is handled or enhanced.
- Know which data types are passively collected and which need active user input.
- Understand Consent vs. Legitimate Interest as two legal grounds, with different opt-in/opt-out models.
